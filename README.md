# Go_examples

There are some examples of my Goland code:

`cond`

`digitalclock`

`dupcall`

`fetchall`

`keylock`

`olympics`

`otp_cipher`

`pubsub`

`rwmutex`

`speller`

`urlfetch`

`urlshortener`

`varfmt`

`waitgroup`

`wordcount`

I will add a short description of every one of them later, but for the most of them you can guess its purpose just by looking at the name
